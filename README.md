# Electronic Ignition System @ [GitHub](https://github.com/34673/Electronic-Ignition-System)
*This repository is currently hosting pseudo-code and unfinished scripts.*

Broad strokes for an engine ignition system with variable timing based on maps/curves.

# Short Term Goals
• Pure C codebase.

• Safe memory stream utilities (read/write).

• Hardware agnostic.

• Externally controllable (map transfers/switching and commands).

• Array, interpolation and formula-based (hardcoded) map supports.


# Ideal/Long Term Goals
• Polished toolsets and/or plugins to create and transfer maps.

• Schematics for open source design.

• Second computer (Raspberry Pi) for high level module monitoring and management using a customizable graphical interface.

• Possible expansions of design for battery charging and fuel injection (?).
